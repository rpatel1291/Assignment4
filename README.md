# CS-554 Assignment 4
# A Markdown Note Downloader
For this assignment, you will create a simple page that allows you to write notes in markdown on one side of the screen and see an HTML preview of those notes on the other side of the screen. You will setup Webpack and React on your own (no create-react-app or other tools). You will use the webpack-dev-server to develop your codebase without Express.

Your markdown preview page should also allow you to set a filename for the note, and download it as either a markdown file (.md) or HTML file (.html) using only frontend JavaScript to achieve the file download. The HTML files saved should be complete HTML documents (semantically valid, as well) and should also include some basic styles (at least for stylizing paragraphs and headings).

This assignment is an open-ended assignment in terms of the UI you deliver; as long as it achieves the basic functionality desired, the exact details (for example, how the UI actually looks; do you use bootstrap; etc) don't matter.

Your application will be a frontend application only; you do not need to write an API of any sort for this assignment.
